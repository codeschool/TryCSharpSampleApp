This is a combination of the Try C Sharp slides and challenges

## How to run this project

To run this code, just clone the repo and make sure you've got the following installed:

1. An IDE or text editor (like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is what I used to update this project)
2. .NET Core, which you can directly from Microsoft's [.NET Core download page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
3. If you're running from command line, goto to the project's root directory and type `dotnet restore` first, and then `dotnet run` to build and run the application so that it's available locally at http://localhost:5000. (Note: Port may vary)
